        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is <b>Chloe Lu</b> and I am a junior at Sage Creek High School in Carlsbad, California.
    One of my passions is engineering, specifically web design/computer science, which is why this website exists!
    I also enjoy photography and playing both indoor and beach volleyball with my friends. </p>
